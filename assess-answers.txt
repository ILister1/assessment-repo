1. SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor;

2. SELECT first_name FROM actor WHERE first_name LIKE 'John';

3. SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor WHERE last_name LIKE 'Neeson';

4. SELECT * FROM actor WHERE actor_id LIKE '%0'

5. SELECT description FROM film WHERE film_id = 100;

6. SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating='R';

7. SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating!='R';

8. SELECT title, length FROM film ORDER BY length ASC LIMIT 10;

9. SELECT title, length FROM film WHERE length > 184;

10. SELECT * FROM film WHERE special_features = 'Deleted Scenes';

11. SELECT last_name 
FROM actor
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1 ORDER BY last_name DESC;

12. SELECT last_name, count(*)
FROM actor
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 ORDER BY count(*) DESC;

13. SELECT t2.first_name, t2.last_name
FROM film_actor t1
JOIN actor t2
ON t1.actor_id=t2.actor_id;

(I tried to work out how to factor in a COUNT(*) and GROUP BY here but it didn't work)

15. SELECT AVG(length) FROM film;

16. SELECT AVG(t1.length), category_id
